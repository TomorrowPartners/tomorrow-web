# Tomorrow Partners website, version next
This is the repository for planning and active development work on [tomorrowpartners.com](http://www.tomorrowpartners.com).

## Why
It’s time for a new website. Our current site is outdated and doesn’t reflect our position in the market or our value proposition as well as it should. 

## Problem statement

The Tomorrow website is intended to meet these goals:

- Get people exited about working with us
- Communicate that we're a great firm who can meet ta potential partner's specific need, and solve a potential partner's specific problem

We have observed that the Tomorrow website isn’t:

- Creating a modern and engaging digital experience that communicates Tomorrow’s value across all sectors

Which is causing these adverse effects:

- Potential customers do not understand how our diverse project background (across sectors) relates to their specific need
- Potential potential customers do not understand that our design strategy experience is a tool that can be applied in many situations

Measurable criteria for success:

- Website views increase
- We field fewer questions from potential partners about how we can solve their problem
- [discuss further measureable criteria with team]
